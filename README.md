# **ResGit: AI-Powered Resume Builder**

## **Inspiration**
Applying for jobs can be time-consuming, especially when tailoring resumes for each position. We wanted to streamline this process by building a tool that helps users quickly generate customized resumes.

## **What It Does**
ResGit reads existing resumes and extracts all experiences and relevant information into a master list. Users can then select specific experiences and details they want to include, and the system compiles a neatly formatted resume.

## **How We Built It**
- **Frontend:** Developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a clean and intuitive user experience.  
- **Backend:** Built with Python Flask, AWS Bedrock, and AWS S3 for efficient data processing and AI-powered enhancements.  
- **Resume Generation:** Implemented using LaTeX for professional and polished formatting.  

## **Challenges We Ran Into**
- Designing a flexible and structured LaTeX template for resumes.  
- Learning and implementing Next.js with limited prior experience.  
- Integrating AWS APIs and handling authentication and invocation complexities.  

## **Accomplishments We're Proud Of**
- Creating a clean and intuitive UI/UX.  
- Achieving fast and reliable resume generation.  
- Successfully completing the project despite technical challenges.  

## **What We Learned**
- Working with **Next.js** and improving frontend development skills.  
- Leveraging **AWS Bedrock** for AI-driven features.  
- Effective team communication and collaboration.  

## **What's Next for ResGit**
- **Deployment** – Making the platform available for users.  
- **AI-Powered Resume Selection** – Implementing an AI feature to automatically select the best experiences and details tail
